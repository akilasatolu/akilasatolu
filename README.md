##### This site is built using TypeScript and designed with React. It leverages Tailwind CSS for styling and Vite as a fast build tool and development server. Routing is handled by react-router-dom, while react-icons provides a collection of icons for UI elements. State management is managed simply and flexibly with Jotai, and useEffect is used for managing component lifecycle effects. The development workflow is automated with GitHub Actions, and the site is hosted using GitHub Pages.
